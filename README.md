#PERSON 2 
### A phenotype means what we can observe or see about a person having a certain disease because of their genes.
## Step 1: Go to OMIM
It is a scientific database used in genetics and bioinformatics to study human genes and genetic disorders.
The official name is Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man.
We had 6 iseases in the table, we started by seraching the first disease.

## Gene phenotype relationship: <br>
Meconium ileus: this  is a condition where this meconium ( dark, thick, sticky first stool of a newborn baby) becomes abnormally thick and sticky, causing a blockage (obstruction) in the small intestine (ileum) . Occurs in 15–20% of CF patients. No specific CFTR mutations determine MI; modifier genes at 19q13.2-q13.4 are implicated.

## GENE PHENOTYPE RELATIONSHIP:

It is characterized by cardinal features in three systems: skeletal (tall stature, long limbs, scoliosis, arched palate), ocular (lens dislocation, myopia), and cardiovascular (aortic root dilatation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse). It is caused by heterozygous mutation in the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15q21. The major life-threatening complications are aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection.

The PheneGene Graphics map for Marfan Syndrome (154700) shows the relationship between the FBN1 gene (134797) and the different diseases it can cause. The map explains that one gene, FBN1, is linked to several related conditions, including Marfan syndrome, Ectopia lentis, MASS syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Geleophysic dysplasia, Marfan lipodystrophy, Acromicric dysplasia, and Stiff skin syndrome. This demonstrates that mutations in a single gene can lead to a wide range of different phenotypes.

# Hemophilia A:<br>

### GENE PHENOTYPE RELATIONSHIP:
Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene, resulting in deficiency of clotting Factor VIII. It is characterized by persistent bleeding after trauma and hemarthroses (joint bleeds) with prolonged PTT, while platelet count and function remain normal. Female carriers have partial Factor VIII deficiency(he body has lower-than-normal levels of Factor VIII, a protein needed for proper blood clotting.) but are usually unaffected.

It shows that the F8 gene (OMIM 300841) is associated with two diseases: Hemophilia A (OMIM 306700) on the left and Thrombophilia 13 (OMIM 301071) on the right, connected in a linear gene-disease relationship map.

# Tay Sachs Disease: <br>

### Gene-Phenoype Relationship:
Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, resulting in Hexosaminidase A deficiency and GM2-ganglioside accumulation in neurons. It presents in infancy with progressive neurodegeneration including psychomotor regression, seizures, hypotonia, blindness, and a characteristic cherry-red spot in the macula, and is usually fatal by age 5 years

It shows that the HEXA gene is linked only to Hex A pseudodeficiency, showing a simple one-to-one gene-phenotype relationship with no other associated conditions.

### Gene-Phenotype Relationship:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 1 (ALS1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene, where nerve cells controlling muscle movement gradually die. This leads to increasing muscle weakness, wasting, and paralysis, along with difficulty speaking and swallowing. About 10% of cases run in families, while the remaining 90% occur sporadically.

The 5 level dispaly is too complex to interpret, hence we will be using the 3 level display.

This graph shows that ALS1 belongs to a large Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis phenotypic series (PS105400), where multiple different genes (including SOD1, DCTN1, NEFH, PRPH) are linked to numerous ALS and Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, demonstrating the significant genetic heterogeneity of ALS with over 30 related phenotypes caused by different gene mutations


# Ellis-van Creveld Syndrome: <br>

Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in the EVC or EVC2 genes, characterized by short-limb dwarfism, extra fingers/toes (polydactyly), nail dysplasia, and congenital heart defects (most commonly atrial septal defect). Additional features include dental abnormalities, narrow chest, and partial cleft lip, with increased frequency among the Amish population.

This graph shows that the EVC and EVC2 genes are linked to Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and share a broader relationship with the Short-rib thoracic dysplasia phenotypic series, highlighting that EVC belongs to a family of ciliopathy-related skeletal disorder
