# BI_Assigment1
variant of three diseases information using omim,clinVAR,Ravel,ACMG and finally annotation. 



#PERSON 2
A phenotype means what we can observe or see about a person having a certain disease because of their genes.
Step 1: Go to OMIM
It is a scientific database used in genetics and bioinformatics to study human genes and genetic disorders.
The official name is Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man.
We had 6 iseases in the table, we started by seraching the first disease.

Gene phenotype relationship:
Meconium ileus: this  is a condition where this meconium ( dark, thick, sticky first stool of a newborn baby) becomes abnormally thick and sticky, causing a blockage (obstruction) in the small intestine (ileum) . Occurs in 15–20% of CF patients. No specific CFTR mutations determine MI; modifier genes at 19q13.2-q13.4 are implicated.   

MARFAN SYNDROME:

GENE PHENOTYPE RELATIONSHIP:

It is characterized by cardinal features in three systems: skeletal (tall stature, long limbs, scoliosis, arched palate), ocular (lens dislocation, myopia), and cardiovascular (aortic root dilatation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse). It is caused by heterozygous mutation in the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15q21. The major life-threatening complications are aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection.

The PheneGene Graphics map for Marfan Syndrome (154700) shows the relationship between the FBN1 gene (134797) and the different diseases it can cause. The map explains that one gene, FBN1, is linked to several related conditions, including Marfan syndrome, Ectopia lentis, MASS syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Geleophysic dysplasia, Marfan lipodystrophy, Acromicric dysplasia, and Stiff skin syndrome. This demonstrates that mutations in a single gene can lead to a wide range of different phenotypes.
